            <h1>My Role as a Developer | Professional</h1>
            <h2>Hi! My Name is Jesse!</h2>

            <p>I Live in Labelle, Florida with my two kids and husband. I have six cats, a dog, and a fish. I enjoy swimming and hanging with the kids.</p>

            <p>Over the last few months I have dived deep into my software journey. During this time I have been learning the key skills to make a good website. Where i have had some challenges with catching on to certain languagesbut i have confidence as i move through my jorney i will get better. I also like the wire framing an the planning of the project.</p>

            <p>I hope to take the knowledge that i have gained in the program and use them in the real world by at first getting better at my skills. Also I would like to begin with free lancing so i can get better at the making them and really decide where i want to take it.</p>

            <p>I plan on continuing my education further so i can get better in the futher and maybe open up my own company.An i would like to dive into cybersecurity as well. </p>
